Shemachoch is special shop that sells goods that are not easily unavailable on the market in Ethiopia. Even though the price is fair and it
used by the government to stablize the market, the process of buying from shemachoch is time consuming and boring. In this project we 
have tried to solve the problem by digitalizing the system. The system is written by JavaFx. It has two branches, first android
app that scans QR and desktop app.
Features of the program:
  1. It is localized(the language of the program can be switched to Amharic)
  2. Create unique QR CODE
  3. Generate monthly report and export to PDF
